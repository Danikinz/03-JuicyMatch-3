# 03-Match-3
Starting place for Project 03 for MSCH-C220

This is an opportunity for you to implement some "juicy" game features (as inspired by the 2012 GDC presentation, "Juice it or Lose it").

Your assignment is to take an existing, boring, match-3 game and to make it as "juicy" as possible.

I will give you the match-3 game (repository coming). Feel free to improve the game experience. You will need to add (at least) a second level, a start menu, and an end-game screen.

Then, please add as many "juicy" features as you would likeâ€”go crazy!  

We will get started like we did with the previous project:

On your GitHub account, go to Repositories and click the green "New" button

 - You should be on the "Create a new repository" form
 - You are the owner of this repository; make the Repository name: 03-Juicy-Match-3
 - Please be careful to use this name and that there are no spaces before or after it in the text box
 - Add a description for this project
 - The repository should be left Public
 - You don't need to initialize this repository with a README (but you will be adding one later)
 - You also don't need to add .gitignore or a license (at this point; just make sure they are present before you turn in the project)
 - Then hit the green "Create repository" button
 - You now have a fresh repository! Clone the new repository in GitHub Desktop
 - You can then download a zip file of this repository and copy its contents into your 03-Juicy-Match-3 folder

The following are some suggestions for things you could try. Please list them in the Implementation section of your README.md:
 - Changing the colors
 - Animate how elements
 - Squeeze and stretch
 - Animate elements when they are selected
 - Shake the screen when something good happens
 - Shake the screen when an error occurs
 - Add sound effects
 - Add music
 - Add particles when an element is added
 - Add particles when an element is removed
 - Make the elements fall off the screen when they are matched
 - Make the elements rotate when they are matched
 - Break the elements when they are matched
 - Add a comet trail to the elements
 - Add eyes?
 - Make the eyes blink?
 - Make the eyes follow the action?
 - Add a smile?
 - Add a background to the game
 - etc.
 - You may also add shaders.

When you are done, update the LICENSE and README.md, commit and push your code to GitHub, and turn in the URL for your repository on Canvas.

I expect your README.md to have (at least) the following headings:
```
# Project Name
